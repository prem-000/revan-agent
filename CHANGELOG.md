## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- **Health endpoint**: `GET /health` reports service status, the version, which LLM backends are configured and whether the research graph is loaded, so a supervisor, container orchestrator or load balancer can decide whether an instance is ready without spending a research request. No network I/O happens by default; `?probe=true` additionally checks whether the Ollama server is reachable (a missing model server is the most common cause of jobs that time out). An unready instance now answers **HTTP 503** with `"status": "degraded"` instead of always returning `200`, so a probe that only inspects the status code cannot mistake a degraded instance for a healthy one:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "version": "0.4.0",
    "graph_loaded": true,
    "llm": {"configured": {"ollama": true, "openai": false}, "ollama_reachable": true},
    "healthy": true
  }
  ```

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-26

### Security

- **LLM cache**: the `@lru_cache`d `_get_llm` no longer includes `api_key` in its cache key (secrets were embedded in cache keys and allowed cross-key poisoning).
- **PDF fetching**: SSRF and resource guards before processing remote documents -- scheme/host allowlist, `max_bytes` cap, shared `ClientSession`, and non-exception results filtered out of `asyncio.gather`.
- **Report export**: markdown-rendered HTML is sanitised (`bleach`/`nh3` with an allow-listed tag set) and topic/source strings are HTML-escaped; `markdown>=3.6`, `bleach`, and `defusedxml` added to `requirements.txt`.
- **Trace crypto**: `encrypt_trace_data` honours the supplied `encryption_salt` (previously ignored and replaced with a random salt, so traces could not be decrypted with the configured salt).

### Fixed

- **DOI resolver**: HTTPS arXiv endpoint, `defusedxml` parsing (XXE), bounded `DOI_CACHE` (1000 entries), validated arXiv ID format, and batch resolution capped at 5 concurrent requests.
- **Factual-consistency checker**: numeric claims must appear within a +/-40-char window sharing a significant token with their claim sentence; the previous bare substring check passed any number appearing *anywhere* in the sources (e.g. "2024" in an unrelated sentence).
- **Hallucination detector**: parses the LLM's JSON reply into `{hallucinations, score}`; unparseable replies return an explicit `parse_error` payload instead of `{"raw_response": ...}`.

---

## Unreleased / In Development

The following capabilities are under active investigation or development and have not yet been incorporated into a formal release:

- Alternative indexing structures (e.g., approximate nearest neighbor) for document ranking at scales exceeding 1,000 sources
- Additional LLM provider integrations beyond the current 11 supported engines
- Enhanced knowledge graph interactivity and filtering controls
- Expanded benchmark coverage for LLM-dependent pipeline stages
- Performance optimization for knowledge graph construction at scale

---

## 2026-10-12 - Upload Pipeline & Test Fixes



### Fixed

- **Upload-only drafting**: `draft_node` aborted with "requires at least one document" when a run had an uploaded PDF but no web sources; uploaded content now counts as a valid source.
- **Upload endpoint errors**: `POST /upload-pdf` returns `400` (not `422`) for an empty filename or a zero-byte file, and the handler owns its filename/empty-file validation; a duplicate `fastapi` import was removed.
- **Retrieval evaluator type import**: `src/evaluation/retrieval.py` annotated with `Any` without importing it (a `NameError` before Python 3.14).
- **Timestamps**: `datetime.utcnow()` (deprecated, scheduled for removal) replaced with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.
- **Upload integration tests**: the PDF fixture now generates documents that clear the extractor's minimum-text validation, so the concurrency and round-trip tests exercise real uploads.
